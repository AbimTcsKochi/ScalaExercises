# Playing with Lists


## Problems

###1. 

Make a list of a few elements, include some duplicate elements
	
  `ex: List(1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 5, 8)`
	
i)  Find the last element of the list
		
	Ans: 8

ii) Find the last but one element of the list, using pattern matching
		
	Ans: 5

iii) Function to find the Kth element of the list
          
    Ans : if k =3, result is 2

iv) Function to return the count of elements in a list given as argument
	         
	Ans:  8

v) Function to return the reverse of a given list as argument
	        
	Ans: List (8, 5, 3, 3, 3, 2, 1, 1)

vi) Function to eliminate the consecutive duplicates of a list (repeated copy of elements should be replaced with a 
    single copy of the element)
	       
	Ans: List(1,2,3,5,8)


###2. 

Make a list which has sub lists as its elements

ex: List (List(1,2), List(3), List(2,3,4,5), List(10))

i) Sort the list and arrange the elements of the main list based on the length of the sublists. 
	
     Ans: List (List(3), List(10), List (1,2), List(2,3,4,5)) 
	 
###3. 

Write Test Cases for all the functions Using assert statements
