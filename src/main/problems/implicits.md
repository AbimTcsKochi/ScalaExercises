##This exercise will cover the basic usage of implicits in Scala

Some reference before you start the exercise to get an idea about implicits

From the above reference links you might find implicit is something than can be applied for a
parameter, method, class etc.

###Problems

1. Implicit Parameters

    - Create a method to print some greetings. Greetings should always end as " Thanks, Digital Earns "
       
        Method defnition should have multiple parameters
     
        first parameter should be passed as an argument while calling it, second argument should be implicit.
        
2. Implicit Conversions

     - Create a method to convert a double value to int
     
        Method should receive a value of double and return its converted int value.
